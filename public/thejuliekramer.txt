Hello world!

My name is Julie Kramer and I am a Wyncode student.

I grew up in Parkland, FL.
 
After graduating from Florida State University I returned to South Florida,
where I worked for a publishing company in Boca Raton for the last three years.

I recently quit my job as Site Editor to learn how to code.
